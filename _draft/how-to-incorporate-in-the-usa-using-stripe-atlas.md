> In our first blogpost, I'd like to talk about how we incorporated in US from outside the USA. This is a version 3.0 post that is inspired from [ V 1.0 by my former boss Girish Mathrubootham](http://blog.freshdesk.com/how-to-incorporate-a-us-corporation-from-outs/) and [V 2.0 by Suresh Sambandam, CEO of KiSSFLOW. ](https://www.chargebee.com/blog/how-to-incorporate-in-the-us-v2/)

The US has one of the most mature banking and financial systems in the world. Owing to this  many internet businesses prefer to incorporate in the US. In India the reserve bank of India does **not** allow businesses to automatically charge user's credit/debit card's; explicit user consent is expected via a second factor authentication like an OTP or a password. This hampers the smooth functioning subscription businesses. However **A US based company can store its user's credit cards and charge them automatically** in a recurring fashion without much hinderance. For the convenience of auto-charging credit cards many 'Subscription As A Service' (SAAS) companies have their headquarted in the US.

Deducely being a SaaS product, we wanted the ability to charge our user's cards every month automatically without asking them to input their card number every month. Since we operate from India our options were very limited, We had 3 options in hand.

1. Incorporate in a foreign country
2. Use [2Checkout](https://www.2checkout.com rel="no-follow") or [FastSpring](http://www.fastspring.com)
3. Use Paypal subscriptions.

We are bootstapped company and we did not want to spend close to $2000 on company incorporation. We wanted to spend that money on purcasing better severs to provide the best exprerience to our users. So option 1 was ruled out. We felt Option 2 was too unfair. We had to part with close to 10% of the money we made to these companies.
