> In our first blogpost, I'd like to talk about how we incorporated in US from outside the USA. This is a version 3.0 post that is inspired from [ V 1.0 by my former boss Girish Mathrubootham](http://blog.freshdesk.com/how-to-incorporate-a-us-corporation-from-outs/) and [V 2.0 by Suresh Sambandam, CEO of KiSSFLOW. ](https://www.chargebee.com/blog/how-to-incorporate-in-the-us-v2/)

The US has one of the most mature banking and financial systems in the world. Owing to this  many internet businesses prefer to incorporate in the US. In India the reserve bank of India does **not** allow businesses to automatically charge user's credit/debit card's; explicit user consent is expected via a second factor authentication like an OTP or a password. This hampers the smooth functioning of subscription businesses that charge users every month. 

However **A US based company can store its user's credit cards and charge them automatically** in a recurring fashion without much hinderance. For the convenience of auto-charging credit cards many 'Subscription As A Service' (SAAS) companies have their headquarted in the US.

Deducely being a SaaS product, we wanted the ability to charge our user's cards every month automatically without asking them to input their card number every month. Since we operate from India our options were very limited

#### We had 3 options in hand:
1. Incorporate in a foreign country
2. Use 2Checkout or FastSpring
3. Use Paypal subscriptions.

We are bootstapped company and we did not want to spend close to $2,000 on company incorporation. We wanted to spend that money on purcasing better severs to provide the best exprerience to our users. So option 1 was ruled out. We felt Option 2 was too unfair. We did not want to part with close to 10% of the money we made to these companies. Option 3 seemed to be the best one at hand still it had one drawback. Paypal is very developer-unfriendly and does not have the best customer support out there. All our dilemma was put to an end when Stripe launched the Atlas program.

**Enter The Atlas Program**

Stripe atlas is a bento box  for busniesses to get up and running. Stripe Atlas grants the following for a flat fee of $500:
1. US company registration (A Delaware C corp).
2. Registering with the IRS for taxation purposes.
3. A Zero balance US bank account in Silicon valley bank. 
4. Acess to Legal and Tax consulation from PwC, Orrick and UpCounsel.
5. **$15,000 in Amazon Web Services Credits.** 
6. A Stripe account ready to accept payments. 

I was also skeptical about this program, I even felt it ws too good to be true but when we approached  [Avinash Raghava](https://twitter.com/avinashraghava) of [iSpirit](http://www.ispirt.in)  and [Suresh Sambandam](https://twitter.com/sureshsambandam) of [KiSSFLOW](https://kissflow.com) for expert opinion, we were asked to go for and incorporate via Stripe Atlas.


We applied around the 24th of February 2016 - the day Stripe Atlas was launched in private beta, we were invited into the progrm by the 3rd of May. However we submitted our application by the 28th of June and by the 4th of July we were incorporated. Pretty neat turn around time I'd opine! So if you are in the subscription business Stripe Atlas in undoubtedly the best way to incorporate your business and collect recurring payments. 

**The Icing in the cake is that since we were one of the pilot companies to be incorporated via the Stripe Atlas program we did not have to spend a dime to get up and running! Thanks [Patrick](https://twitter.com/patrickc)!, We owe you one or rather many!**
